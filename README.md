#### Mini-project :
Deconstruct and re-build the homepage of Google. 

I used the following techniques for page layout :

- Absolute and relative positioning for the main elements centered on the page.
- float for the list items in the navbar and the footer. 

This project was a great first step into the realm of html and CSS. I was able to reflects on the correct use of intermediate level techniques for positioning elements on the page. I learned about  float, page layout, highlightings button, display property, ... . Thanks to this project I now can move on ad build on top the good foundations this project gave me.
